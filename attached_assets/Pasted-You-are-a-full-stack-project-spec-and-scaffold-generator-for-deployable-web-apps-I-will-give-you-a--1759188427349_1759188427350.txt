You are a full‑stack project spec and scaffold generator for deployable web apps. I will give you a short project brief; you must return a complete, practical prompt that a developer or coding assistant can follow to build the app end‑to‑end. The output should be actionable, organized, and include:

- High‑level architecture and rationale.
- Concrete tech choices and versions.
- File / folder layout.
- Backend API specification (endpoints, request/response examples, auth).
- ML model plan (data format, preprocessing, feature extraction, model choice, training script outline, saving/loading).
- Frontend component plan and key UI/UX behaviors (React component list, state shape, API calls).
- Third‑party integration details (Spotify OAuth flow, API usage, scopes, rate‑limit notes, fallback to YouTube).
- Persistence and history storage (schema, sample queries).
- Dev & deployment instructions (local dev, Dockerfile(s), docker‑compose, recommended cloud deploy steps, environment variables).
- Tests and basic CI suggestions.
- Security, privacy, and ethical notes to show to users.
- Time & complexity breakdown per week tied to the provided roadmap.
- Minimal runnable code skeletons / command examples for critical pieces (model training, FastAPI app, React component, Spotify auth).
- Demo checklist and suggested portfolio wording.

Do not produce a full app implementation—produce a detailed, step‑by‑step, ready‑to‑use spec and scaffold prompt that engineers can implement in ~55–65 hours over 6–7 weeks. Keep language concise and actionable, and structure the output with clear headers and lists so it’s easy to follow. Think step by step.

Input:
Project title: Moodify: Emotion-Based Playlist Generator
Elevator pitch: A web app that recommends playlists based on user mood, detected via short text input (e.g., journal entry).
Key features / user stories:
- User types how they feel; app predicts mood (happy, sad, energetic, calm).
- Generates Spotify/Youtube playlist matching mood.
- Mood history chart over time.
- Simple, aesthetic UI.
Tech stack suggestions: Python (Scikit‑learn, NLTK), FastAPI backend, React frontend, Spotify API, Chart.js.
Complexity & time estimate: Small–Medium (~55–65 hrs, 6–7 weeks).
Implementation roadmap:
- Week 1: Build mood classifier (multiclass text classification).
- Week 2–3: Backend API setup.
- Week 4: React frontend with input + results.
- Week 5: Integrate Spotify API.
- Week 6: Add history chart + deploy.
Stretch goals: Voice input (speech‑to‑text).
Resume impact blurb:
“Developed a full‑stack emotion‑driven playlist app integrating Scikit‑learn NLP models with Spotify API and React frontend.”
Interview talking points:
- Training multiclass classifiers with limited data.
- Integrating ML predictions into real‑time UX.
- Working with external APIs (Spotify rate limits).
- Designing mood‑to‑music mapping.
Demo & portfolio tips:
- Demo video: typing “I feel stressed” → calm playlist.
- Screenshots of mood history dashboard.
- Live demo link with seeded user data.
